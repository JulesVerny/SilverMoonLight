The works and offerings from SilverMoonLight Studios.

## Low Poly Casual Game Development

- Leos Farm Adventure (https://simmer.io/@JulesWombat/leo-s-little-farm)
- Farm Wars (Utilising the Unity RTS Framework) (https://simmer.io/@JulesWombat/farm-wars)
- Basic Real Time Strategy (Bottom Up)   (https://simmer.io/@JulesWombat/basic-rts) and design code at (https://github.com/JulesVerny/BasicRTS)
- Town Simulation (with Lions)  (https://simmer.io/@JulesWombat/simple-town)

These are developed in Unity, and typically availbale on Simmer IO type platforms vie WebGL builds

## Reinforcement Learning Research: With Unity ML- Agents

The research into the use of Reinforcement learning Algorithms.  The concept, design and development details into this RL research can be found on the other GIT repositories, sibling to this one.
